SuperLU for Debian
==================

SuperLU might be useful in conjunction with some other packages like:
petsc or arpack. Otherwise it is widely used in the scientific
computing community.


Warning about removed functionality
-----------------------------------

Since version 4.3, SuperLU contains non-free code, which is used for implemented
the so-called MC64 functionality. This code has been stripped from the Debian
package.

Concretely, this means that you cannot use 'options->RowPerm = LargeDiag' for the
{S,D,C,Z}GSISX routines.
